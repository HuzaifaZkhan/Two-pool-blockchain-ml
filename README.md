# Two-Pool Blockchain with ML-Enhanced Urgency Scoring

This project solves the problem of unfair transaction prioritization in traditional blockchains, where high-fee transactions delay urgent ones (e.g., hospital payments). It introduces a two-pool mempool system with machine learning for fair urgency detection.

## Problem
In single-mempool blockchains, miners prioritize profitable (high-fee) transactions, sidelining low-fee but urgent ones. This creates inequities
